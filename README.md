This is a repository of people offering help to teach/guide someone that I found mostly online.*

It's just a quick screencap of their tweets, so if you're interested in reaching out to them, you can find them by their username.**

As of today, this repo only stores tweets who cover subjects I'm interested in, and is separated into several folders below:

-android, java
-arduino, hardware, embedded
-front-end, web
-general, career
-writing
-misc

Feel free to explore this repo to find the right mentor for yourself.

Addendum:

*Through Stephanie Hurlburt's Twitter.

**Pray they haven't changed it, if they had, use Twitter search feature to search their tweet word for word.
