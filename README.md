This is a repository of people offering help to teach/guide someone that I found online.*

It's just a quick screencap of their tweets, so if you're interested in reaching out to them, you can find them by their username.**

As of today, this repo only stores tweets who cover subjects I'm interested in, and is separated into folders below:

-android, java
<br>-arduino, hardware, embedded
<br>-front-end, web
<br>-general, career
<br>-writing
<br>-misc

Feel free to explore this repo to find the right mentor for yourself.

Addendum:

*Mostly through Stephanie Hurlburt's Twitter.

**Pray they haven't changed it, if they had, use Twitter search feature to look for their tweet word for word.
